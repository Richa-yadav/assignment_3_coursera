              <p>
                Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising
                them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine
                of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.Chicken can be
                prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many
                others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a
                staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower
                concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.
                Vegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, and the flesh of any other animal), and may also include abstention from by-products of animal slaughter.[1][2]

Vegetarianism may be adopted for various reasons. Many people object to eating meat out of respect for sentient life. Such ethical motivations have been codified under various religious beliefs, as well as animal rights advocacy. Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related, political, environmental, cultural, aesthetic, economic, or personal preference. There are variations of the diet as well: an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet includes both eggs and dairy products, an ovo-vegetarian diet includes eggs but not dairy products, and a lacto-vegetarian diet includes dairy products but not eggs. A vegan diet excludes all animal products, including eggs and dairy. Avoidance of animal products may require dietary supplements to prevent deficiencies such as vitamin B12 deficiency, which leads to pernicious anemia.[3][4] Psychologically, preference for vegetarian foods can be impacted by one's own socio-economic status and evolutionary factors.[5][6][7]

Packaged and processed foods, such as cakes, cookies, candies, chocolate, yogurt, and marshmallows, often contain unfamiliar animal ingredients, and so may be a special concern for vegetarians due to the likelihood of such additives.[2][8] Feelings among vegetarians may vary concerning these ingredients. Some vegetarians scrutinize product labels for animal-derived ingredients[8] while others do not object to consuming cheese made with animal-derived rennet or are unaware of its presence.[2][2][9][10]

Semi-vegetarian diets consist largely of vegetarian foods but may include fish or poultry, or sometimes other meats, on an infrequent basis. Those with diets containing fish or poultry may define meat only as mammalian flesh and may identify with vegetarianism.[11][12] A pescetarian diet has been described as "fish but no other meat".[13]
